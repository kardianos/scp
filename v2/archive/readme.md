# Chiral Harmonic Particle Theory (CHPT) Model

Designed to simulate a field of constant energy, where energy is defined as the density gradient of the field itself.

## Thinking

Imagine a 3D+time field that operates with the following principles:

 * There is no intrinsic friction.
 * When a field forms knots (atoms, other particles), the density of the individual knots are higher, which means the density of the field is lower. Gravity is the accumulative "back-pressure" of space. The greater the "mass", the less able it is to push back from the surounding field density itself.
 * Individual knots of density can only increase density in certain patters, pushing knots together too much forces them apart generally when the interaction is close (the knoted field reduces the broad effect of the field, but up close it increases it, think of the effective surface area is consentrated).
 * Stable patterns can emerge from 3d+time harmonics.
 * Patterns can either be chiral or symmetrical.
 * In a 3D+time field we have two chiral types.
 * Like a 1D violin string which vibrates on the entire string, a 3D harmonic vibrates around the entire 3d shape at the same time.
 * When two chiral based harmonics encounter each other, the harmonics repel each other. Not like a magnate, but due to back propagation of density and least energy stability interactions. Back-propagation repultion enforces minimal spread in position/momentum for chirals.
 * A non chiral based harmonic will pass through other patterns will little interaction other then slight interaction with density gradients.
 * If a stable harmonic is broken up due to unstable pattern, such as being too large in a slightly unstable pattern or by smashing them together with much energy, they can form many unstable patterns which quickly degrade.
 * Null-rotors (projective geometric algebra) energy patterns can oscillate between a stable harmonic pattern and density wave. This can oscillate at different frequencies.
 * All harmonics have movement, that's what let them be a harmonic. All stable harmonics will emit null-rotor patterns proportional to the speed of their harmonic to the fourth power (3D+time) as a way to cool to a lower energy (lower density) harmonic.
 * A single unmatched chiral pattern, when forced to move, will also emit null-rotor patterns and density waves, all perpendicular to each other and the movement of the chiral pattern. This perpendicular structure is fixed orientation just like the chiral pattern is fixed.
 * Harmonics can overlap to form composite states that interfere through density gradients before collapsing to stable patterns.
 * Two chirals of the same type cannot overlap, but two different oriented chirals may share the same space.
