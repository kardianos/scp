# CHPT Conceptual Satisfaction of Immutables

## 1. Speed of light (c) constant/invariant
- Intrinsic max rate for harmonic propagation/null-rotor oscillation in field (readme: all harmonics propagate at field limit).
- Option: Field density uniform globally → constant transformation speed.

## 2. Conservation (energy, momentum, charge, angular momentum)
- Total field energy/density constant (readme: constant energy field).
- Knots redistribute local density/momentum without loss.
- Charge/angular from chiral topology invariants.
- Option: Global field balance enforces all.

## 3. Gravity: attractive, ~1/r², weakest, universal
- Back-pressure from surrounding field depletion around knots (readme explicit).
- ~1/r² from spherical density gradient spread.
- Weakest: Geometric, not direct overlap repulsion.
- Option: Cumulative for composites.

## 4. Particle spectra (masses, charges, spins)
- Discrete stable 3D chiral harmonics (readme: specific patterns).
- Mass ∝ density (knot complexity).
- Spin from orbital chirality.
- Charge from null-rotor emission asymmetry.
- Option: Hierarchical nesting for generations/composites.

## 5. Nuclear stability, fusion/fission
- Different chirals nest/overlap stably (readme: different share space).
- Same chirals repel/exclude (Pauli-like).
- Fusion: Energy overcomes repulsion → new harmonic.
- Fission: Unstable knot breaks to lower densities.
- Option: Shell-filling rules from geometry.

## 6. Electromagnetic phenomena (Coulomb, spectra, polarization)
- Coulomb: Null-rotor emissions from moving charged knots (readme: ~speed⁴).
- Spectra: Harmonic frequencies.
- Polarization: Chiral selectivity in interference.
- Option: Perpendicular emissions for unmatched chirals.

## 7. Relativity: E=mc², time dilation
- E=mc²: Mass (density) × c² (propagation energy).
- Dilation: Observer propagation rate vs. field limits (readme: propagation not classical motion).
- Option: Knot reformation sequences stretch "time".

## 8. Cosmology: expansion (Hubble), CMB uniformity, element abundances
- Expansion: Field dissipation/spread post-knotting.
- CMB: Initial uniform harmonic decay.
- Abundances: Early stable knot formation (H/He ratios from simple chirals).
- Option: Chiral interference homogenizes early field.

## 9. Galaxy rotation curves, lensing (DM effects)
- Gradients from aggregate knot densities mimic extra mass (readme: back-pressure scales).
- Curves: Extended field depletion halos.
- Lensing: Density refraction in gradients.
- Option: "Dark" (non-emitting) stable harmonics.

## Modifiable: CHPT Predictions/Refutations/Alternatives

### 1. Quantum probabilities/uncertainty
- **Refutes**: Deterministic field mechanics; "uncertainty" from incomplete null-rotor observation.
- **Options**: Hidden variables in chiral phases; chaotic interference patterns.

### 2. Wave-particle duality
- **Predicts**: Emergent—knots (particles) emit/oscillate as null-rotor waves.
- **Options**: Dual states (stable ↔ density wave, per readme); scale-dependent.

### 3. Entanglement/non-locality
- **Alternative**: Geometric chirality linking via shared field topology.
- **Options**: Instant density propagation; correlated null-rotor emissions.

### 4. SM symmetries (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1))
- **Alternative**: Emergent from chiral harmonic nesting rules.
- **Options**: 3D knot symmetries mimic color/weak; unification via full rotations.

### 5. Infinities/renormalization in QFT
- **Refutes**: Finite knot geometries prevent UV divergences.
- **Options**: Discrete harmonics as natural cutoff; no point singularities.

### 6. Hierarchy problem (masses)
- **Predicts**: Natural from harmonic complexity/stability levels.
- **Options**: Geometric scaling in nesting; density gradients.

### 7. Dark energy (~68%)
- **Predicts**: Global field expansion from density dilution.
- **Options**: Vacuum null-rotor pressure; accelerating back-pressure loss.

### 8. Black hole info paradox
- **Refutes**: No event horizons—gradients refract info outward.
- **Options**: Info encoded in external field harmonics; conserved topology.

### 9. Arrow of time/entropy increase
- **Alternative**: Emergent from irreversible knot formation (stable > unstable).
- **Options**: Chiral propagation asymmetry; density diffusion.
