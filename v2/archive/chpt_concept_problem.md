# CHPT Conceptual Problems

## Internal Inconsistencies
- **Quantization origin**: Continuous field → discrete stable knots? Initial fluctuation mechanism missing.
- **Chirality source**: Isotropic field lacks handedness; how chirals emerge/persist?
- **Stability selection**: Why specific 3D harmonics stable (e.g., electron/proton)? No energy minimization rule.
- **Charge definition**: Null-rotor asymmetry vague; conservation across knot formation?
- **Emission scaling**: ~speed⁴ dimensional? Energy source for photons?
- **No dissipation**: Eternal propagation contradicts observed decoherence/redshift.

## Observation Mismatches
- **Force strengths**: Back-pressure too strong/repulsion dominates gravity quantitatively?
- **Particle zoo**: Predicts limited harmonics; explains 3 generations/colors?
- **Quantum phenomena**: No clear path to uncertainty/duality/entanglement.
- **Neutrino masses/oscillations**: Null-rotors massless; chiral mismatch?
- **Cosmology**: Uniform field → inflation? CMB power spectrum from knots?
- **Relativity details**: Frame-dragging, equivalence principle from geometry?
- **DM/DE**: Gradients quantitative for halos/acceleration?

**Note**: Conceptual only; no math. Prioritize resolution order.

## Resolutions to Conceptual Problems (Verbose)

These address foundational issues, strengthening CHPT:

### Knot Origin
- High-density regions (e.g., Big Bang) spontaneously form knots to relieve excessive back-pressure by localizing density.
- Expansion through density stages naturally yields atomic-scale knots.
- **Satisfies**: Explains quantization without ad-hoc fluctuations.

### Chirality Origin
- Emerges from handedness in 3D+time knot topologies; multiple inequivalent knotting ways create persistent left/right chirals.
- Field isotropy broken by initial knot asymmetries propagating.
- **Satisfies**: Topological invariance in continuous field.

### Stability & Particle Zoo
- Stability via 3D+time harmonic resonance; unstable knots degrade to field over time (e.g., resonances).
- No explicit minimization; effective via continuous null-rotor emit/receive—stable patterns persist longest.
- Explains zoo: Hierarchy of harmonics (stable atoms, unstable exotics).
- **Satisfies**: Discrete spectra, decays.

### Dissipation
- No microscopic friction (field ideal); dissipation geometric (null-rotor emission/absorption, knot degradation).
- Knots frictionless internally, but interact via field.
- **Satisfies**: Eternal propagation + observed loss (redshift, decoherence).
