# CHPT Unification of Physics Concepts

Chiral Harmonic Particle Theory (CHPT) unifies physics via a frictionless 3D+time field of constant total energy density. Particles emerge as stable \"knots\"—discrete chiral harmonics with localized high density, depleting surrounding field. Key principles:

- Gravity: Back-pressure from field gradients around knots (~1/r²).
- Chirals: Same-handedness repel (Pauli exclusion); opposites overlap stably (nuclear binding).
- Propagation: All at field speed limit *c* via null-rotor oscillations.
- Emissions: Null-rotors ~speed⁴ from motion, enabling EM/photons.
- Stability: Resonant 3D+time patterns persist; unstables degrade.
- Composites: Interference/nesting forms atoms/hadrons.

## Immutable Concepts (Fully Satisfied)

### 1. Speed of Light (c) Constant/Invariant
Harmonic propagation/null-rotor oscillation limited by uniform field transformation rate. No medium variability; *c* intrinsic to field geometry.

### 2. Conservations (Energy, Momentum, Charge, Angular Momentum)
Global field density/momentum totals fixed. Knots redistribute locally without net loss. Charge/spin as topological invariants (chiral handedness/asymmetry).

### 3. Gravity: Attractive, ~1/r², Weakest, Universal
Knots deplete local field; surrounding higher-density field \"pushes back\" cumulatively, scaling ~1/r² spherically. Weakest as indirect geometric effect vs. direct chiral overlaps (strong/EM).

### 4. Particle Spectra (Masses, Charges, Spins)
Masses ∝ knot density/complexity (stable 3D harmonics). Charges from null-rotor emission asymmetry. Spins from orbital topology in 3D+time.

### 5. Nuclear Stability, Fusion/Fission
Opposite chirals nest stably (proton=up/down quarks). Same chirals exclude. Fusion overcomes repulsion for new harmonics; fission degrades unstables to lower densities.

### 6. Electromagnetic Phenomena (Coulomb, Spectra, Polarization)
Coulomb: Perpendicular null-rotor emissions from accelerating/moving charged knots (~speed⁴ intensity). Spectra: Knot oscillation frequencies. Polarization: Chiral selectivity in waves.

### 7. Relativity: E=mc², Time Dilation
E=mc²: Knot density (m) × propagation energy (c²). Dilation: Observer knot sequences stretch vs. field limits in relative propagation.

### 8. Cosmology: Expansion (Hubble), CMB Uniformity, Element Abundances
Expansion: Global field dilution post-knotting. CMB: Relic uniform harmonics from early density. Abundances: Simple chiral formations (H/He) in cooling field.

### 9. Galaxy Rotation Curves, Lensing (DM Effects)
Extended density-gradient halos around knot aggregates provide extra back-pressure. Curves flat from halo scale; lensing via field refraction.

## Modifiable Concepts (Predictions/Resolutions)

### 1. Quantum Probabilities/Uncertainty
Deterministic field; apparent randomness from incomplete null-rotor/chiral phase observation. Hidden variables in interference chaos.

### 2. Wave-Particle Duality
Emergent: Stable knots emit/oscillate as density waves/null-rotors. Scale-dependent: particle-dominant small, wave large.

### 3. Entanglement/Non-Locality
Geometric: Shared chiral topology links via field; correlated emissions propagate instantly in density.

### 4. SM Symmetries (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1))
Emergent from 3D chiral nesting (3 colors, weak doublets); full rotations unify at higher harmonics.

### 5. QFT Infinities/Renormalization
Refuted: Finite knot geometries, no point singularities/UV divergences. Discrete harmonics as cutoff.

### 6. Hierarchy Problem (Masses)
Natural: Geometric scaling in harmonic complexity/nesting levels.

### 7. Dark Energy (~68%)
Global field expansion from dilution; vacuum null-rotor pressure accelerates.

### 8. Black Hole Information Paradox
Refuted: No horizons—gradients refract info outward; topology conserved in external field.

### 9. Arrow of Time/Entropy Increase
Emergent: Irreversible knotting favors stables; chiral asymmetry/diffusion directionality.

## Open Conceptual Challenges (To Resolve)
- Exact harmonic selection (electron/proton specifics).
- Neutrino masses/oscillations (null-rotor masses?).
- 3 generations/colors from topology?
- Frame-dragging/equivalence from geometry.
- Quantitative force strengths/emission scaling.

This conceptual framework aims for full unification; mathematical formalization next.
