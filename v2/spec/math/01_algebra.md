# Math Spec 01 — The Algebra and Field

## 1. The Algebra: Cl(3,0,1)

We adopt **Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**, denoted as $Cl(3,0,1)$ or $\mathbb{R}_{3,0,1}$.

### Basis Vectors
The algebra is generated by four orthogonal basis vectors: $\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$.
*   $e_1, e_2, e_3$: Spatial basis vectors. $e_i^2 = 1$ (Euclidean signature).
*   $e_0$: The degenerate basis vector (representing the ideal plane/point at infinity). $e_0^2 = 0$.

### Geometric Interpretation
*   **Space**: The 3D Euclidean space is modeled projectively. Points are trivectors, lines are bivectors, and planes are vectors.
*   **Degeneracy**: The condition $e_0^2 = 0$ implies that the dimension associated with $e_0$ is distinct from spatial dimensions. In CHPT, we map this to the **Process Dimension** (Density/Time).

## 2. The Fundamental Field $\Psi$

The fundamental entity of CHPT is a **multivector field** $\Psi(x)$ valued in the even subalgebra $Cl^+(3,0,1)$.

$$ \Psi = \rho + \vec{J} e_0 + \mathbf{F} + I \tau $$

Where the components map to physical quantities:

| Component | Type | Grade | Basis Elements | Physical Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\rho$ | Scalar | 0 | $1$ | **Mass Density** (The "stuff") |
| $\vec{J}$ | Vector-like | 2 (degenerate) | $e_{01}, e_{02}, e_{03}$ | **Flux / Current** (Motion of density) |
| $\mathbf{F}$ | Bivector | 2 (spatial) | $e_{12}, e_{23}, e_{31}$ | **Field Strength / Null Rotors** (Internal Twist) |
| $I \tau$ | Pseudoscalar | 4 | $e_{0123}$ | **Helicity / Volume** (Topological winding) |

### Note on Dimensionality
Unlike standard relativity which treats time as a spatial dimension ($t \to x_4$), Cl(3,0,1) treats the "4th" dimension $e_0$ as degenerate. This supports the **Process Ontology**: time is not a place you can go to; it is the *evolution parameter* of the spatial configuration.

## 3. The Derivative Operator

The geometric derivative $\nabla$ in Cl(3,0,1) is **purely spatial**:
$$ \nabla = \sum_{i=1}^{3} e_i \partial_i $$

**Critical**: Because $e_0^2 = 0$ (degenerate), the degenerate direction does not contribute a time derivative. Therefore $\nabla^2 = \partial_1^2 + \partial_2^2 + \partial_3^2$ is the **Laplacian** (elliptic), not the d'Alembertian (hyperbolic).

**Time enters separately**: The time derivative $\partial_t$ is an **external parameter**, not part of the geometric derivative. The full equation of motion (see `spec/math/03_dynamics.md`) has the form:
$$ \frac{1}{c^2}\partial_t^2 \Psi - \nabla^2 \Psi + \cdots = 0 $$
where the hyperbolic (wave) structure comes from the explicit $\partial_t^2$ term combined with the spatial $\nabla^2$. This is consistent with Process Ontology: time is the evolution parameter, not a geometric dimension on equal footing with space.

## 4. Why This Algebra?

1.  **Natural Projectivity**: It handles "points at infinity" naturally, which is crucial for defining the boundary conditions of knots (finite energy $\to$ vacuum at infinity).
2.  **Dual Quaternions**: The even subalgebra is isomorphic to the **Dual Quaternions** $\mathbb{H} + \varepsilon\mathbb{H}$ ($\varepsilon = e_0$, $\varepsilon^2 = 0$). Every field value decomposes as $\Psi = q + e_0 p$ where $q = \rho + \mathbf{F}$ is the **bulk** (rotational quaternion) and $p = \vec{J} + \tau I_3$ is the **weight** (translational part). This structure provides two independent norms: $|q|^2 = \rho^2 + |\mathbf{F}|^2$ and $|p|^2 = |\vec{J}|^2 + \tau^2$, both essential for the Lagrangian (see `spec/math/03_dynamics.md`, §5).
3.  **Hopf Fibration**: The mapping $S^3 \to S^2$ (Hopf fibration) which defines the simplest knot is naturally expressed in the spinor representation of this algebra.

## 5. Next Step: The Lagrangian

The dynamics of $\Psi$ are governed by an action principle. The full Lagrangian density (derived in `spec/math/03_dynamics.md`) has **four terms**:

$$ \mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2c^2}\langle \partial_t \Psi\, \widetilde{\partial_t \Psi}\rangle_0 - \frac{1}{2}\langle \nabla \Psi\, \widetilde{\nabla \Psi}\rangle_0}_{\mathcal{L}_2\text{ (kinetic)}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{4e^2}\sum_{\mu<\nu}\langle [R_\mu, R_\nu]^2 \rangle_0}_{\mathcal{L}_4\text{ (Skyrme)}} - \underbrace{\frac{\lambda}{4}(\langle \Psi\tilde{\Psi}\rangle_0 - \rho_0^2)^2}_{V\text{ (bulk potential)}} - \underbrace{\frac{\mu^2}{2}(|\vec{J}|^2 + \tau^2)}_{V_D\text{ (degenerate mass)}} $$

where $R_\mu = \tilde{\Psi}\partial_\mu\Psi$ are the right-currents. The Skyrme term $\mathcal{L}_4$ stabilizes solitons (Derrick evasion). The degenerate mass term $V_D$ uses the dual quaternion weight norm $|p|^2$ to give mass to the pseudoscalar and flux modes (which are invisible to the standard Clifford norm because $e_0^2 = 0$). The theory has five parameters: $(\rho_0, \lambda, e, \mu, c)$.
