# Math Spec 01 — The Algebra and Field

## 1. The Algebra: Cl(3,0,1)

We adopt **Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**, denoted as $Cl(3,0,1)$ or $\mathbb{R}_{3,0,1}$.

### Basis Vectors
The algebra is generated by four orthogonal basis vectors: $\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3\}$.
*   $e_1, e_2, e_3$: Spatial basis vectors. $e_i^2 = 1$ (Euclidean signature).
*   $e_0$: The degenerate basis vector (representing the ideal plane/point at infinity). $e_0^2 = 0$.

### Geometric Interpretation
*   **Space**: The 3D Euclidean space is modeled projectively. Points are trivectors, lines are bivectors, and planes are vectors.
*   **Degeneracy**: The condition $e_0^2 = 0$ implies that the dimension associated with $e_0$ is distinct from spatial dimensions. In CHPT, we map this to the **Process Dimension** (Density/Time).

## 2. The Fundamental Field $\Psi$

The fundamental entity of CHPT is a **multivector field** $\Psi(x)$ valued in the even subalgebra $Cl^+(3,0,1)$.

$$ \Psi = \rho + \vec{J} e_0 + \mathbf{F} + I \tau $$

Where the components map to physical quantities:

| Component | Type | Grade | Basis Elements | Physical Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\rho$ | Scalar | 0 | $1$ | **Mass Density** (The "stuff") |
| $\vec{J}$ | Vector-like | 2 (degenerate) | $e_{01}, e_{02}, e_{03}$ | **Flux / Current** (Motion of density) |
| $\mathbf{F}$ | Bivector | 2 (spatial) | $e_{12}, e_{23}, e_{31}$ | **Field Strength / Null Rotors** (Internal Twist) |
| $I \tau$ | Pseudoscalar | 4 | $e_{0123}$ | **Helicity / Volume** (Topological winding) |

### Note on Dimensionality
Unlike standard relativity which treats time as a spatial dimension ($t \to x_4$), Cl(3,0,1) treats the "4th" dimension $e_0$ as degenerate. This supports the **Process Ontology**: time is not a place you can go to; it is the *evolution parameter* of the spatial configuration.

## 3. The Derivative Operator

The geometric derivative $\nabla$ in this space is:
$$ \nabla = \sum_{i=1}^3 e_i \partial_i $$
(Note: The derivative with respect to the degenerate direction usually does not appear in the spatial $\nabla$, but time evolution $\partial_t$ enters via the equation of motion).

## 4. Why This Algebra?

1.  **Natural Projectivity**: It handles "points at infinity" naturally, which is crucial for defining the boundary conditions of knots (finite energy $\to$ vacuum at infinity).
2.  **Dual Quaternions**: The even subalgebra is isomorphic to the **Dual Quaternions**, which are the natural language of 3D rigid body mechanics (rotation + translation). A "particle" (knot) is essentially a localized rigid body of field; its dynamics (spin + momentum) map perfectly to dual quaternions.
3.  **Hopf Fibration**: The mapping $S^3 \to S^2$ (Hopf fibration) which defines the simplest knot is naturally expressed in the spinor representation of this algebra.

## 5. Next Step: The Lagrangian

The dynamics of $\Psi$ are governed by an action principle. The simplest plausible Lagrangian density is:

$$ \mathcal{L} = \langle \nabla \Psi \widetilde{\nabla \Psi} \rangle_0 - V(\Psi) $$

This will be derived in `spec/math/03_dynamics.md`.
