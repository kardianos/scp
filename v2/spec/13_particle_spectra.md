## The Observed Particle Spectrum

The Standard Model contains the following fundamental particles:

### Fermions (spin-1/2) — Three Generations

| Generation | Leptons | Quarks |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1st | electron (0.511 MeV), electron neutrino (<0.1 eV) | up (2.2 MeV), down (4.7 MeV) |
| 2nd | muon (106 MeV), muon neutrino (<0.1 eV) | charm (1.27 GeV), strange (96 MeV) |
| 3rd | tau (1.78 GeV), tau neutrino (<0.1 eV) | top (173 GeV), bottom (4.18 GeV) |

### Bosons (force carriers)

| Boson | Mass | Spin | Force |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| Photon | 0 | 1 | Electromagnetic |
| W+/W- | 80.4 GeV | 1 | Weak |
| Z | 91.2 GeV | 1 | Weak |
| Gluon (8 types) | 0 | 1 | Strong |
| Higgs | 125 GeV | 0 | Mass generation |
| Graviton (hypothetical) | 0 | 2 | Gravity |

### Key Patterns

1. **Three generations**: The fermions come in three copies that are identical except for mass. No one knows why three.
2. **Mass hierarchy**: Masses span 12 orders of magnitude (neutrino ~0.1 eV to top quark ~173 GeV).
3. **Charge quantization**: All charges are integer multiples of e/3.
4. **Spin-statistics**: Fermions (half-integer spin) obey Pauli exclusion; bosons (integer spin) do not.
5. **Antimatter**: Every fermion has an antiparticle with opposite charge and same mass.

## CHPT Predictions for the Spectrum

### What CHPT Claims

1. Particles are stable knots (3D+time harmonics) of a single field.
2. Mass = density excess of the knot.
3. Charge = chirality of the knot.
4. Spin = internal angular momentum of the oscillation pattern.
5. The discrete spectrum of stable knots maps to the discrete particle spectrum.

### What CHPT Must Derive

For the theory to be taken seriously as physics (not just philosophy), it must compute specific numbers from the field equation. At minimum:

**Tier 1 — Essential (theory is dead without these)**:
- The existence of stable knot solutions (any at all).
- At least two distinct stable knots with different masses (showing a discrete spectrum exists).
- One knot with spin-1/2 and one with spin-1 (showing both fermions and bosons emerge).
- Chirality producing two mirror-related knots (particle/antiparticle).

**Tier 2 — Necessary (theory is not useful without these)**:
- Mass ratios between specific knots matching known particles (e.g., m_proton / m_electron ≈ 1836).
- Correct charge assignments (electron charge = -1, up quark charge = +2/3, etc.).
- Correct magnetic moments (electron g-factor = 2.0023...).

**Tier 3 — Predictive (theory becomes compelling only with these)**:
- Prediction of all known particle masses from the field equation parameters.
- Explanation of three generations.
- Prediction of a NEW particle or property not yet observed.

### Current Status

CHPT has achieved **none of these tiers**. This is not surprising — the field equation has not been written down. But it is important to be honest: without any derived numbers, CHPT is a qualitative narrative, not a physical theory. The transition from narrative to theory requires solving the mathematical problem of finding stable solutions to a nonlinear field equation in 3+1D.

## The Three-Generation Problem

Why are there three generations of quarks and leptons? The Standard Model provides no answer; it is a free input. CHPT must either:

### Option A — Derive Three from Geometry

In 3D, there are three independent rotation planes (xy, xz, yz). If each generation corresponds to a dominant excitation in one of these planes, three is natural.

**Problem**: This would predict exactly three generations for ALL particles, which matches observation. But it also predicts that the three generations differ only in their rotational structure, which should produce mass ratios related to the geometry of 3D rotations. The actual mass ratios (electron:muon:tau ≈ 1:207:3477) do not have an obvious geometric origin.

### Option B — Derive Three from Stability

Perhaps there are exactly three levels of harmonic complexity that produce stable knots for each particle type. The simplest harmonic is the lightest (first generation). The next-simplest is heavier (second generation). The third is heavier still. Fourth and higher are unstable (no fourth generation).

**Problem**: Why exactly three stability levels? This needs a mathematical demonstration.

### Option C — Three Is Accidental

The number of generations is a contingent fact about the specific field equation parameters, not a deep geometric truth. A different field equation might produce two or four generations.

**Problem**: Reduces the explanatory power of the theory.

### Status

All three options are open. None is developed.

## Mass Hierarchy

The mass spectrum spans many orders of magnitude:
- Lightest massive particle: neutrino (~0.05 eV)
- Heaviest: top quark (173 GeV)
- Ratio: ~10^12

In CHPT, mass = density excess. So the top quark's knot has ~10^12 times the density excess of the neutrino's knot. Why such a vast range?

### Possible Mechanisms

1. **Harmonic complexity**: Higher-order harmonics (more nodes, more complex 3D patterns) naturally have more density excess, similar to how higher-order vibration modes of a drum have more energy.

2. **Geometric scaling**: If each successive knot type involves an additional layer of structure (like nested Russian dolls), the density could scale geometrically with the number of layers.

3. **Fine-tuning**: The mass ratios are not natural; they must be matched by carefully chosen parameters in the field equation. This would be disappointing (standard physics already has this problem), but honest.

### The Electron-Proton Mass Ratio

m_proton / m_electron ≈ 1836.15

In the Standard Model, the proton mass arises almost entirely from QCD binding energy (gluon field energy), not from quark masses. The quark masses contribute only ~1% of the proton mass. The rest is the energy of the strong force field inside the proton.

In CHPT: the proton is a composite knot (three sub-knots). Its mass must be primarily from the binding density between the sub-knots, not from the sub-knots themselves. This is actually natural in CHPT — the density between overlapping sub-knots is a real part of the composite's total density.

### Unknown

- **Can the field equation produce the observed mass values?** This is the ultimate quantitative test and cannot be answered without a specific field equation.

## Particle Stability and Lifetimes

| Particle | Lifetime | CHPT Stability |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Proton | > 10^34 years | Must be topologically stable |
| Electron | Stable | Must be topologically stable |
| Neutron (free) | ~880 seconds | Dynamically metastable |
| Muon | 2.2 microseconds | Dynamically unstable |
| Pion (charged) | 26 ns | Dynamically unstable |
| W/Z | ~10^-25 seconds | Extremely unstable |
| Top quark | ~10^-25 seconds | Extremely unstable |

CHPT must explain this vast range of lifetimes (from eternal to 10^-25 seconds) from the field dynamics:

- **Stable particles** (proton, electron): Topologically protected knots that cannot decay without violating a conserved topological charge.
- **Long-lived unstable particles** (neutron, muon): Knots with large energy barriers to decay. The decay involves tunneling or a rare field fluctuation.
- **Short-lived resonances** (W/Z, top quark): Knots with very small energy barriers. They decay almost immediately after formation.

The decay rate depends on the barrier height and width, which in turn depend on the knot geometry. CHPT must demonstrate that the correct hierarchy of lifetimes emerges.

## Composite Particles

### Hadrons

Hadrons (protons, neutrons, pions, etc.) are composites of quarks. In CHPT, they are composite knots.

**Baryons** (3 quarks): Three sub-knots overlapping to form a stable composite. The three sub-knots must have different "colors" (whatever that means in CHPT; see [09_nuclear_interactions.md](09_nuclear_interactions.md)).

**Mesons** (quark + antiquark): A sub-knot and its mirror-chiral partner overlapping. The composite is unstable (eventually annihilates).

**Exotic hadrons** (tetraquarks, pentaquarks): Recently observed at LHC. Four or five sub-knots in composite states. CHPT should naturally allow these if multi-sub-knot composites are permitted.

### Atoms and Beyond

Atoms are composite structures: nuclear knot + electron knots in resonant orbitals. CHPT adds nothing new here — the description reduces to quantum mechanics for atomic structure.

## Predictions and Falsifiability

For CHPT to be falsifiable (and therefore scientific), it must make predictions that differ from the Standard Model. Possible unique predictions:

1. **No fundamental scalar particles**: If knots are inherently rotating (spin from internal dynamics), spin-0 particles like the Higgs might be composites or collective modes rather than fundamental. If the Higgs is predicted to be composite, this is testable at future colliders.

2. **Maximum particle mass**: If there is a maximum knot density (field saturation), there is a maximum possible particle mass. This could be observable as an energy ceiling in particle production.

3. **Specific resonance patterns**: The knot spectrum might predict specific particle masses not yet observed, or specific relationships between known masses.

4. **No proton decay**: If baryon number is topologically exact, proton decay is absolutely forbidden (not just suppressed). Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) predict proton decay; CHPT (with topological stability) predicts it never happens. This is testable with sufficiently large proton decay experiments.

## Summary

| Aspect | Standard Model | CHPT | Status |
|--------|---------------|------|--------|
| Why three generations? | Unknown | 3D geometry? Stability levels? | No answer |
| Mass hierarchy origin | Yukawa couplings (free params) | Harmonic complexity? | No answer |
| Charge quantization | Group theory (SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)) | Chiral winding quantization? | No answer |
| Proton stability | Baryon number conservation (accidental symmetry in SM) | Topological invariant | Plausible |
| Antimatter | CPT theorem | Mirror chirality | Natural |
| Neutrino mass | Unknown mechanism | Unknown mechanism | No answer |
| Specific mass values | 19 free parameters | Derived from field equation? | No equation yet |

### Honest Bottom Line

CHPT's particle sector is entirely promissory. The conceptual framework is suggestive — knots as particles, chirality as charge, harmonics as the spectrum — but zero quantitative results exist. The gap between concept and calculation is enormous. Closing it requires writing down the field equation and solving for stable knot solutions. This is a well-defined mathematical research program, but it has not yet been started.
