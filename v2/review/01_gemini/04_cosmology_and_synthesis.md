# CHPT Review 04 — Cosmology, Dark Sector, and Synthesis

## 1. The Dark Sector: Matter and Energy

### Dark Matter
CHPT's explanation for dark matter is the most straightforward of any alternative theory: **Dark matter is just normal matter that happens to be uncharged.**

*   **Mechanism**: Stable knots that lack chirality (charge) and lack the specific harmonic resonance to couple to the electromagnetic field.
*   **Mass**: They have density $\rho > \rho_0$, so they gravitate.
*   **Interaction**: They interact only via gravity (depletion zones) and potentially weak/contact forces.
*   **Status**: This is a direct prediction of the knot spectrum. If stable non-chiral knots exist, they *are* dark matter.

### Dark Energy
CHPT struggles with Dark Energy (accelerated expansion).
*   **Vacuum Energy**: The theory defines $\rho_0$ as the zero-energy state. If the vacuum has no energy, a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is unnatural.
*   **Expansion**: If "expansion" is just the dilution of the field density over time, there is no obvious driver for *acceleration*.
*   **Speculation**: Perhaps the field has a "surface tension" or negative pressure component at cosmological scales. This is undeveloped.

## 2. Black Holes: Horizons Without Singularities

General Relativity predicts singularities (infinite density) because it assumes matter collapses to a point. CHPT avoids this naturally.

*   **Mechanism**: Matter collapses. Density increases.
*   **Limit**: The field has a maximum possible density (saturation) or a nonlinear restoring force that halts collapse at a finite radius.
*   **Result**: A "Black Star" or "Gravastar."
    *   **External**: Metric is Schwarzschild. Event horizon exists (null-rotors cannot escape).
    *   **Internal**: Smooth, high-density fluid. No singularity. No information loss paradox (information is preserved in the internal state).

This is a superior physical picture to standard GR.

## 3. Final Synthesis: The Path to CHPT 2.0

The review concludes that CHPT 1.0 (the qualitative proposal) is insufficient, but a **CHPT 2.0** mathematical theory is viable and worth pursuing.

### The Unified Recipe
1.  **Field**: A multivector field $\Psi$ in $Cl(3,0,1)$ space.
2.  **Equation**: A nonlinear Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = \langle \nabla \Psi \nabla \Psi^\dagger - V(\Psi) \rangle$ (schematic).
3.  **Particles**: Soliton solutions $\Psi_{knot}$ of the field equation.
4.  **Quantum**: Bohmian mechanics applied to the conservation of the probability current $J = \Psi \gamma^0 \Psi^\dagger$ (schematic).
5.  **Gravity**: The effective acoustic metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ acting on small perturbations $\psi$.

### Recommended Next Steps for the Research Program
1.  **Linear Sector**: Prove Maxwell's equations from the linearized $Cl(3,0,1)$ wave equation.
2.  **Soliton Sector**: Simulate 3D nonlinear wave equations to find stable knot solutions.
3.  **Gravity Sector**: Derive the effective metric for a static spherical knot and check PPN parameters.

CHPT has the potential to be a "Theory of Everything" in the literal sense: one field, one equation, all physics. The cost is abandoning local realism and embracing the complexity of 3D non-linear dynamics.
