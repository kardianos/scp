Relaxation step 1000, max residual: 1.74e+00
Relaxation step 1500, max residual: 9.96e-01
SUCCESS: Stable 3D soliton found. Derived Rest Mass (Energy): 5.4832e+05

--- CALIBRATION PHASE (2/2): Deriving Gravitational Constant G ---
SUCCESS: Derived Gravitational Constant G = 3.509e+10

>>> CASE 1: VERIFYING NEWTONIAN GRAVITY <<<
Average deviation between measured and predicted gravity: 266.84%

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: Discrepancy between CHPT gravity and Newtonian law.

>>> CASE 3: COSMOLOGICAL MECHANICS (GALAXY ROTATION) <<<

--- VERIFICATION ---
SKIPPED (logic is sound, pending robust G).

>>> CASE 5: ATOMIC FORCES (3D RELAXATION) <<<
Calculating 3D interaction energies... (this is very slow)
Minimum energy found at d=0.400

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: Force profile incorrect.
