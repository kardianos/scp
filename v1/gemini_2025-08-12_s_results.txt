>>> CASE 5a: SINGLE SPINOR SOLITON STABILITY TEST (v11 Solver) <<<
Desired: The integrated density of a single particle should remain constant.
Running stable Operator Splitting simulation...
Observed: Integrated density changed by 36464.965798% over 5000 steps.

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: Soliton is unstable even with the advanced solver. The physics model needs revision.

--- FRAMEWORK UNSTABLE: Further simulations are invalid. ---

Total execution time: 1756.61 seconds.
