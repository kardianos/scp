>>> CASE 5a: PREREQUISITE STABILITY TEST <<<
Desired: Particle number must be conserved to machine precision.
Observed: Particle number changed by 0.000000%
--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS: Soliton is stable.

>>> CASE 2: RELATIVISTIC REST MASS <<<
Desired: A positive, finite rest mass/energy.
Observed: Mass-energy proxy (particle number) = 492.18
--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS: Stable soliton has non-zero mass.

>>> CASE 1: VERIFICATION OF GRAVITY <<<
Desired: Emergent gravity must match Newtonian 1/r^2 law.
Observed: Deviation from Newton's law is 100.0000%
--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE.

>>> CASE 3: GALAXY ROTATION CURVE <<<
Desired: A flat rotation curve without dark matter.
Observed: Inner velocity=0.0 km/s, Outer velocity=0.0 km/s
--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: Rotation curve is not flat.
