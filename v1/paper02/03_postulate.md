### Geometric Harmonic Field Theory (GHFT) Postulate

From first principles: Reality is a single geometric field where all phenomena emerge from foldable structures, akin to origami defining shapes through creases. Spacetime is not a passive arena but a dynamic substrate φ (dimensionless, [0,1] range) representing local foldability—how readily space can form stable patterns. Density ρ (kg/m³) warps φ via Poisson-like equation ∇²φ = -4πGρ/c⁴, linking mass to curvature without separate fields.

Matter manifests as harmonic vibrations in localized folds: particles are standing waves with energy E = h f_n, where f_n = n c / (2L) for mode n in fold size L ≈ h/(m c) (Compton wavelength). This yields quantized spectra, e.g., atomic levels E_n ∝ -1/n² from circular folds, aligning with observed discreteness without ad-hoc quanta.

Chirality χ = ±1 encodes handedness in crease angles; interactions follow U = k χ_i χ_j / r (J), with k >0. Opposite χ mesh (U<0, attract) like interlocking panels; same repel (U>0) due to geometric mismatch—steric hindrance in rigidity terms. Rigidity matrix R (3×3 for toy proton) has det(R) >0 for stable folds, rank<6 allowing 3D freedom but constraining via energy minima.

Proton (uud quarks modeled as three creases: χ=[1,1,-1]) stabilizes via net attraction from opposites; simulation yields U ≈ -0.265 (normalized), scaling k_fit ≈ 3.02×10^{-12} J m to match nuclear binding ~8×10^{-13} J at r~10^{-15} m. Neutron (udd: χ=[-1,-1,1]) meshes with proton due to unmatched χ, enabling nuclei but allowing decay from imbalance.

Origami math: Crease graph with vertices (folds), edges (panels); Laplacian eigenvalues λ_min ≈3 (non-zero min for triangle graph) set fundamental frequency f=√λ/(2π)≈0.276 (dimensionless; physical Hz via c/L). Multi-properties (spin, color) as abstract crease coordinates—e.g., SU(3) from 3-cycle folds, treating as extra "dimensions" in matrix without spatial extension.

Goal: Unify GR/QM via geometry; matter/forces from intrinsic folds, not dual entities. Constructive: Simulation assumes dot product for R—expand to cross for full vector chirality. Converge k via gradient descent on data fits; test against plasmonic analogs for meshing deviations.
