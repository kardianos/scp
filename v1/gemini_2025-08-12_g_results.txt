>>> CASE 1 (REVISED): CLASSICAL MECHANICS (NEWTONIAN GRAVITY) <<<
Checking for 1/r^2 law far from the source:
Mean value of |a|*r^2: 2.79e+09
Standard deviation of |a|*r^2: 1.52e+10 (544.74%)

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: The acceleration does not follow a stable 1/r^2 law.

>>> CASE 3 (REVISED): COSMOLOGICAL MECHANICS (GALAXY ROTATION) <<<
Orbital velocity near peak (r=4050 pc): 36809.5 km/s
Orbital velocity in halo (r=20050 pc): 14308.0 km/s

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: The rotation curve is not flat or collapsed to zero.

>>> CASE 4 (REVISED): EMF PROPAGATION (DOUBLE-SLIT INTERFERENCE) <<<
Found 288 points with >80% intensity (peaks).
Found 206 points with <10% intensity (troughs).

--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS: A clear interference pattern with multiple peaks and troughs was generated.

>>> CASE 5 (REVISED): ATOMIC FORCES <<<
Force at large separation (d=1.50): 1.24e+00
Force at small separation (d=0.05): -6.15e+01
Minimum energy found at separation d = 0.050

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: The force profile is incorrect.

>>> CASE 6 (REVISED): 'QUANTUM' TUNNELING VIA FDTD <<<
Particle kinetic energy: 0.012. Barrier height: 1.500
Intensity before barrier (reflected): 0.00%
Intensity after barrier (tunneled): 73.97%

--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS: A significant, non-zero portion of the wavepacket has tunneled through the barrier.
