>>> CASE 1: VERIFICATION OF LONG-RANGE GRAVITY FIELD <<<
Desired Result: a_chpt should match a_newton.
Observed Result: Average deviation is 0.0206%

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: The CHPT gravity model is not self-consistent.

>>> CASE 2: RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS (REST MASS) <<<
Desired Result: A positive, finite rest energy.
Observed Result: Calculated Rest Energy = 2.1919e+01

--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS: Non-zero rest mass calculated.

>>> CASE 4: EMF PROPAGATION (DOUBLE-SLIT INTERFERENCE) <<<
Desired Result: A clear interference pattern with multiple peaks and troughs.
Observed Result: Generated pattern with 572 peaks.

--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS (regression test passed).

>>> CASE 5: ATOMIC FORCES (4D CHIRAL FDTD) <<<
Desired Result: Repulsion at short range, attraction at mid-range, observed from particle trajectories.
Running 4D FDTD simulation... (this is the slowest part)
