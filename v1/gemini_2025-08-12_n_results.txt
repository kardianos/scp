>>> MODEL 1: EFFECTIVE CHIRAL POTENTIAL <<<
Desired: Potential well for anti-aligned spins; repulsion for aligned spins.
Observed (Anti-aligned): Found potential well with binding energy 0.05 at d=5.00
Observed (Aligned): Minimum energy is -12.77, indicating no binding.

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: The model does not produce the correct profile.

>>> MODEL 2: MODULATED CHIRAL FORCE (4D FDTD) <<<
Desired: Repulsion at short range due to intense chiral force in overlap region.
Observed: Initial separation = 7.871, Final separation = nan

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: Model did not produce significant repulsion.

>>> MODEL 3: MULTI-COMPONENT (SPINOR) FIELD (4D FDTD) <<<
Desired: Force profile emerges naturally from coupled equations.
Step 0, Separation: 7.000
Step 200, Separation: -2.240
Step 400, Separation: 1.053
Step 600, Separation: -4.828
Step 800, Separation: 0.957
Step 1000, Separation: -0.001
Step 1200, Separation: 0.839
Step 1400, Separation: -3.760
Step 1600, Separation: -0.215
Step 1800, Separation: -0.014
Observed: Initial separation = 7.000, Final separation = -0.014

--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS: Spinor model produced a net attractive force.
