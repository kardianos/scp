>>> CASE 5a: SINGLE SPINOR SOLITON STABILITY TEST <<<
Desired: The integrated energy of a single particle should remain constant.
Running stability simulation...
Observed: Integrated energy changed by nan% over 4000 steps.

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: Single soliton is unstable. Halting further tests.

>>> CASE 4: EMF PROPAGATION (DOUBLE-SLIT INTERFERENCE) <<<
Desired: Clear interference pattern.
Observed: 572 peaks.
--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS.
