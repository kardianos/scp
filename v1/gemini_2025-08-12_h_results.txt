>>> CASE 1 (FINAL): CLASSICAL MECHANICS (GRAVITY) <<<
Relaxing soliton profile to find true ground state... (this may take a moment)
Relaxation step 0, max residual: 1.50e+00
Relaxation step 500, max residual: nan
Relaxation step 1000, max residual: nan
Relaxation step 1500, max residual: nan
Relaxation complete.
Mean value of |a|*r^2: nan
Standard deviation of |a|*r^2: nan%

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: The acceleration does not follow a stable 1/r^2 law.

>>> CASE 5 (FINAL): ATOMIC FORCES <<<
Force at large separation (d=1.50): 1.24e+00
Force at small separation (d=0.10): -1.27e+01
Minimum energy (binding) found at separation d = 0.100

--- VERIFICATION ---
FAILURE: The force profile is incorrect.

>>> CASE 6 (FINAL): 'QUANTUM' TUNNELING VIA FDTD <<<
Particle kinetic energy: 0.0079. Barrier height: 0.0500
Saved plot to gemini_2025-08-12_h_case_6_tunneling.png
Reflected Intensity: 14.76%
Tunneled Intensity: 36.05%

--- VERIFICATION ---
SUCCESS: A small but non-zero portion of the wavepacket has tunneled through the barrier.

Total execution time: 22.71 seconds.
