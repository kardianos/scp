# Spacetime Curvature Pattern (SCP) Model

Designed to simulate a field of constant energy, where energy is defined as the density gradient of the field itself.

## Thinking

Imagine a 3D+time field that operates with the following principles:

 * There is no intrinsic friction.
 * When a field forms knots (atoms, other particles), the density of the individual knots are higher, which means the density of the field is lower. Gravity is the accumulative "back-pressure" of space. The greater the "mass", the less able it is to push back from the surounding field density itself.
 * Individual knots of density can only increase density in certain patters, pushing knots together too much forces them apart generally when the interaction is close (the knoted field reduces the broad effect of the field, but up close it increases it, think of the effective surface area is consentrated).
 * Stable patterns can emerge from 3d+time harmonics.
 * Patterns can either be chiral or symmetrical.
 * In a 3D+time field we have two chiral types.
 * Like a 1D violin string which vibrates on the entire string, a 3D harmonic vibrates around the entire 3d shape at the same time.
 * When two chiral based harmonics encounter each other, the harmonics repel each other. Not like a magnate, but due to back propagation of density and least energy stability interactions. Back-propagation repultion enforces minimal spread in position/momentum for chirals.
 * A non chiral based harmonic will pass through other patterns will little interaction other then slight interaction with density gradients.
 * If a stable harmonic is broken up due to unstable pattern, such as being too large in a slightly unstable pattern or by smashing them together with much energy, they can form many unstable patterns which quickly degrade.
 * Null-rotors (projective geometric algebra) energy patterns can oscillate between a stable harmonic pattern and density wave. This can oscillate at different frequencies.
 * All harmonics have movement, that's what let them be a harmonic. All stable harmonics will emit null-rotor patterns proportional to the speed of their harmonic to the fourth power (3D+time) as a way to cool to a lower energy (lower density) harmonic.
 * A single unmatched chiral pattern, when forced to move, will also emit null-rotor patterns and density waves, all perpendicular to each other and the movement of the chiral pattern. This perpendicular structure is fixed orientation just like the chiral pattern is fixed.
 * Harmonics can overlap to form composite states that interfere through density gradients before collapsing to stable patterns.
 * Two chirals of the same type cannot overlap, but two different oriented chirals may share the same space.

### SCP Toy Model Features
SCP (Spacetime Curvature Pattern) redefines the original toy as localized density-induced curvatures in a 3D+time field, with no friction, density warping for attraction, resistance for repulsion, and harmonics as vibrating curvature modes. Modifications: Integrate posits like superposition via overlaps, uncertainty from vibration spreads, tunneling via null-rotor mediation, entanglement from correlated fragments, and spin via parity twists. Add new: Gauge-like symmetries from curvature invariants, Lorentz invariance for relativistic harmonics. Each feature maps to QM, with geometric explanation (curvature as metric bends g_μν, density ρ as source).

1. **Density-Induced Warping**  
   - QM Mapping: Gravitational potential in Schrödinger equation, Ĥ = - (ℏ²/2m)∇² + V, with V ~ -Gρ/r.  
   - Geometric Explanation: Higher ρ curves field lines inward (positive Ricci R > 0), paths "fall" along geodesics, mimicking attraction; resistance flattens curves (R < 0) to prevent singularities.

2. **Harmonic Vibration Modes**  
   - QM Mapping: Quantized energy levels, E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω for oscillator.  
   - Geometric Explanation: Coherent oscillations ripple curvature across 3D extent, forming closed loops (toroidal for stability); discrete modes from boundary conditions on warped metric.

3. **Chiral Twists (Two Types)**  
   - QM Mapping: Spin-1/2, Pauli matrices σ, with [σ_i, σ_j] = 2iε_ijk σ_k.  
   - Geometric Explanation: Odd-parity helicoidal bends (left/right-handed spirals) in density, antisymmetric under 2π rotation (flips sign), requiring 4π for identity via Möbius-like topology.

4. **Symmetrical Modes**  
   - QM Mapping: Integer spins (bosons), symmetric wavefunctions ψ(x1,x2) = ψ(x2,x1).  
   - Geometric Explanation: Even-parity spherical/ellipsoidal curvatures, invariant under 2π, allowing multi-overlaps as concentric shells without phase flips.

5. **Repulsion via Back-Propagation**  
   - QM Mapping: Pauli exclusion, antisymmetric ψ for fermions.  
   - Geometric Explanation: Approaching chiral twists interfere, amplifying local curvature gradients (steep Ricci spikes), pushing apart along least-action geodesics for energy minimization.

6. **Pass-Through Interactions**  
   - QM Mapping: Bosonic statistics, [a, a†] = 1.  
   - Geometric Explanation: Symmetrical modes slide along mild density curves without twisting, minor deflections as geodesic perturbations, enabling condensation in shared wells.

7. **Fragmentation and Degradation**  
   - QM Mapping: Decay processes, e.g., via Feynman diagrams in QFT.  
   - Geometric Explanation: High-energy collisions shatter curvature coherence into irregular shards (unstable R fluctuations), which smooth out via resistance, dissipating to flat space.

8. **Null-Rotor Oscillations**  
   - QM Mapping: Particle-wave duality, de Broglie λ = h/p.  
   - Geometric Explanation: Alternating between compact curvature knots (particle-like) and propagating ripples (wave-like), with frequency ω setting geodesic oscillation scales.

9. **Emission ~ Speed^4**  
   - QM Mapping: Blackbody radiation, P ~ σ T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann).  
   - Geometric Explanation: Faster vibrations stretch curvature anisotropically (higher multipole moments), radiating null-rotors as detached waves proportional to (geodesic deviation)^4 for cooling.

10. **Perpendicular Emissions from Accelerated Chirals**  
    - QM Mapping: Bremsstrahlung, radiation ~ a^2 in QED.  
    - Geometric Explanation: Forced motion twists chiral orientation, spawning orthogonal curvature planes (E/B-like), fixed by handedness, propagating perp. to velocity vector.

11. **Superposition of Overlaps** (Posited)**  
    - QM Mapping: Linear combos, ψ = c1 φ1 + c2 φ2.  
    - Geometric Explanation: Interfering curvatures blend metrics (averaged g_μν) before density resistance collapses to dominant geodesic path.

12. **Uncertainty from Spreads** (Posited)**  
    - QM Mapping: Heisenberg Δx Δp ≥ ℏ/2.  
    - Geometric Explanation: Harmonic size delocalizes curvature focus, blurring geodesics; tighter confinement steepens gradients, increasing momentum-like deviations.

13. **Entanglement in Fragments** (Posited)**  
    - QM Mapping: Non-local correlations, Bell states |ψ⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2.  
    - Geometric Explanation: Shattered harmonics link daughter curvatures via shared twist orientations, preserving correlations along separated geodesics.

14. **Tunneling Mediation** (Posited)**  
    - QM Mapping: WKB approximation, P ~ exp(-2∫√(2m(V-E)) dx / ℏ).  
    - Geometric Explanation: Null-rotors temporarily flatten barrier curvature, allowing evanescent geodesic extensions through forbidden regions exponentially damped by width.

15. **Gauge Symmetries from Invariants** (New Addition)**  
    - QM Mapping: U(1) for EM, covariant derivative D_μ = ∂_μ - ig A_μ.  
    - Geometric Explanation: Curvature scalars (R) invariant under local twists, with null-rotors as connection fields A_μ mediating phase shifts along paths.

16. **Lorentz Invariance for Harmonics** (New Addition)**  
    - QM Mapping: Dirac equation, iℏ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ = m c ψ.  
    - Geometric Explanation: Harmonic vibrations preserve form under boosts, with chiral twists transforming as spinors, ensuring geodesic intervals ds^2 = η_μν dx^μ dx^ν remain invariant.

Feedback: List synthesizes consistently but risks overgeneralization without explicit metric equations; derive testable predictions from curvatures to validate mappings.
